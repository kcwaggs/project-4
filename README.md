# project-4
We want to determine if a machine learning model can predict a song trackâ€™s danceability (from Spotify sourced data) based on several inputs such as song speed, tempo, valence, duration, etc.

### Processing:

1. First, download the [main_dataset.csv](resources/main_dataset.csv) from Kaggle as our core data.
2. Next, preprocess and clean the data using the [main_dataset_preprocessing.ipynb](./main_dataset_preprocessing.ipynb) file.
3. Then, query the dataset using the [sql_conversion.ipynb](./sql_conversion.ipynb) file.
4. Finally, create the model using the [datamodel_neuralnetwork_karen.ipynb](./datamodel_neuralnetwork_karen.ipynb) file.


## Notes 
Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable. \
Our team also attempted to model for a song's popularity, and were unable to create a model that could predict popularity with meaningful predictability. \


## Results
Our model was able to predict a song's danceability with 81.9% accuracy.
